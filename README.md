# Emacs.d 

This is an .emacs.de config focused for Clojure development. It was originally forked from https://github.com/bendisposto/emacs.d (working on a Mac with US Keyboard), but I have modified it slightly so that it will work on my Linux 64-Bit computer with a US Keyboard layout.

The original config file was created by Ryan Neufeld (https://gist.github.com/rkneufeld/5126926)

# Changes

- German Umlauts are accessible via M-a, M-u and M-o
- Added Yasnippets
- smex is triggered via either M-x, M-z or s-3 (s is CMD on a Mac)
- dirtree is triggered using s-1
- Shit-Arrows navigate between frames
- fn is shown as a lambda symbol rather than f
